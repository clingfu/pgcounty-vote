## Documentation
Welcome to the documentation section of our README! This should guide you, a future developer on our application, through the nooks and crannies of our web app!
### Onboarding
If you are new to npm, node.js, or even Git, this is the place for you! Here you will find what you need as a developer when you've just cloned this repository from Github.
1. If you have not installed node.js, [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download node.js. When you install node.js it automatically installs npm along with it so don't worry about it!
2. If you have not installed git, [click here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for a guide on installing git on various machines!
3. After installing Git, node.js, and npm, open your gitbash console and navigate to your repository.
```
cd {insert repository name here}
```
4. When you're in the main directory of our repository, run the following command
```
npm i
```
5. Once you've installed all of the packages necessary for our web app, run the following command and your application should be running on localhost:3000! (Unless you have a separate application running on the port 3000.)
```
npm run start
```
6. Once you've got the repository running, you have to be aware of branching and pull requests, [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) should explain basic branching and merging, and [this document](./docs/pull-requests.md) should help you make your first pull request in our Github repository!
